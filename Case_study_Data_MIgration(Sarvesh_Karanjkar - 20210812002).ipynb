    "**Comprehensive Data Mapping Plan:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Extraction:**\n",
    "   - Utilize Python libraries such as `pandas` or `SQLAlchemy` to connect to ABC Utility Company's databases.\n",
    "   - Extract consumer data from relevant tables using SQL queries or directly using APIs if available.\n",
    "   - Store the extracted data in pandas DataFrames  for further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Mapping:**\n",
    "   - Create a mapping document that defines how each column from ABC Utility Company's data aligns with the fields in SMART360's consumer table.\n",
    "   - Match each column from ABC Utility Company's data with the corresponding field in SMART360's consumer table based on similarity and relevance.\n",
    "   - Resolve any discrepancies between column names, data types, and formats between the source and target systems.\n",
    "   - Ensure proper handling of missing or null values during mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Transformation and Loading:**\n",
    "   - Write Python scripts to transform the extracted data according to the mapping defined.\n",
    "   - Convert data types, format addresses, and normalize data as required to match SMART360's schema.\n",
    "   - Handle any data cleansing or enrichment processes during transformation.\n",
    "   - Load the transformed data into SMART360's consumer tables using appropriate APIs or database connectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Validation and Testing:**\n",
    "   - Develop test cases to validate the accuracy and completeness of the integrated consumer data.\n",
    "   - Compare the data loaded into SMART360 against the source data to ensure alignment.\n",
    "   - Perform data quality checks such as checking for duplicates, invalid entries, and consistency across fields.\n",
    "   - Conduct regression testing to ensure that any changes or updates to the Python scripts do not impact data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Deployment:**\n",
    "   - Deploy the Python scripts to automate the data integration process within ABC Utility Company's environment.\n",
    "   - Configure scheduled tasks or event triggers to execute the scripts at predefined intervals or in response to specific events.\n",
    "   - Monitor the automated process for any errors or failures and implement logging mechanisms for troubleshooting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Documentation of Mapping Process:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Mapping Document:**\n",
    "   - Document detailing the mapping between each column in ABC Utility Company's data and the corresponding field in SMART360's consumer table.\n",
    "   - Include explanations for any transformations or adjustments made during mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mapping Summary:**\n",
    "   - Summary document outlining the key mappings and transformations applied during the integration process.\n",
    "   - Provide rationale for mapping decisions and any considerations for future updates or modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Dictionary:**\n",
    "   - Comprehensive documentation listing all columns in both ABC Utility Company's data and SMART360's consumer table.\n",
    "   - Describe the data type, format, and meaning of each column to ensure clarity and consistency across teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Test Plan and Results:**\n",
    "   - Document detailing the test cases developed and executed during the validation phase.\n",
    "   - Include descriptions of test scenarios, expected outcomes, and actual results.\n",
    "   - Highlight any issues encountered during testing and the resolutions applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Deployment Guide:**\n",
    "   - Step-by-step instructions for deploying and configuring the Python scripts within ABC Utility Company's environment.\n",
    "   - Provide guidance on setting up scheduled tasks or event triggers for automated execution.\n",
    "   - Include troubleshooting tips and best practices for monitoring the data integration process.\n",
